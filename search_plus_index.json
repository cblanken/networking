One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses. This is the full text of our Intro to Security Fundamentals course. This course will not teach you how to be a hacker or a pentester. During this course you will learn theory, application, and examples of real-world threats and build a mental model for yourself about how this field works. This site is generated from a Moodle course hosted at: https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=9 All the material is available here, but in order to get the full benefits of our course we recommend registering so that we can track your progress, grade your submissions, and provide feedback and support when you need it.

Who do you want to protect it from? How likely is it that you will need to protect it? How bad are the consequences if you fail? How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those? For this exercise, our list of things we are trying to protect will be your email account and your phone's photos. For each, write down where it?s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it. Think of three possible threat actors who might want to get a hold of your data or communications. It might be an individual, a government agency, or a corporation. Think about what each adversary might want to do with your private data Think about what the likelihood of each adversary coming for that data Think about what happens to you if the adversary gets that data Now try to answer the question, how much trouble are you willing to go through in order to prevent loss. Delete everything you just wrote Write a few sentences on why threat modeling is important Undelete everything you just deleted if you did it electronically. Write down who could have gotten to the list you just deleted Make the decision of whether or not you need to delete the list you just made for yourself. If so, delete it. If you made it on Google Drive, good luck. This is a brain stretching exercise, so don't worry too much. What would it take for a hostile entity to capture what you just wrote down, depending on where you did it. Is it on a piece of paper, a local word document, a google doc? All of those require very different attacks. One important note is that you might not have anything worth a targeted attack personally, but you have access to other things that might be interesting to other people. For example, your contact lists can be used to identify other, more important targets. Even more dangerous, someone could use your account to send phishes to your contacts. A @navy.mil address is going to have a significantly higher click rate than some random @gmail. You also have access to your network, so someone could use you to pivot to a network you have access to. Visit the course page!

A huge part of this training is providing you with the mental models required to think about security. By providing the general framework, you can fill in the gaps, or at least start working towards filling the gaps. But sometimes, mental models just don't cut it. You need something on paper, written in blood, that will help you do what you need to do in order to be successful. Risk assessment models give organizations a way to identify problems and address them in a quantitative and structured manner. There are a ton of them out in the wild, but the most important one for most people is NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This is the general framework that all DoD and .gov sites adhere to. There are other specific frameworks like ISO27001, CIS Critical Security Controls, HIPAA (health data), PCI DSS (credit cards and banking), and countless others but those don't matter much to you other than knowing they exist. A good knowledge of NIST will get you most of the way there. Tasks: So many things to do here.

So how has security adapted to face all these threats? Basically, the most modern idea is the idea of defense in depth, making it so the bad guys have to beat layer after layer of security in order to get in, and then back out. The go-to model is the cyber killchain by Lockheed Martin, and while it gets a ton of crap, it is honestly a very good way of looking at it. https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf Make sure you know the different layers of the killchain.

One of the most common arguments against the killchain is that \"Actions on Objectives\" is too vague. For one, all of the other steps of the killchain can occur as an action on objective if the attacker uses it to attack something else, which is known as pivoting. But there are many other \"post-exploitation\" objectives of an attacker, which range from installing backdoors to bricking the device. There are 5 P's of Post-Exploitation: Persistence = Find a way to maintain access Privilege Escalation = Find a way to get a higher level of access than you already have Pilfer = Steal things Pillage = Break things. Pivot = Move from one box to another and start the killchain all over again. I will write a good post on this at some point, but for now, just try to remember what each of those things means. Task: Describe a hypothetical attack on a user via email, using your current understanding, from recon all the way through all the post exploitation possibilities.

As we went over earlier, if a sufficiently advanced attacker wants to get into your stuff specifically, they will. But we have looked at our threat model before and have determined we are probably not a person of interest to the NSA/Mossad/FSB, right? Right??? So according to our threat model, the most likely people to hack us will be random criminals who don't care who we are, they're just trying to get in. While it is an over simplification, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\". If you are able to harden yourself ahead of time and not be an easy target, you will be much less likely to get hit with a non-targeted attack, and in the possibility that you ever are targeted, you will be more likely to not get caught off guard. These are some of the most common of the reasons you might get hacked. You are already hacked!! The most common way to get malware on your computer is to already have malware on your computer. Seriously, as I was first writing this section, I ran a scan on my shared family computer I am using and removed 5 separate PUPs and 1 piece of adware. Shared computers, whether family, work, or libraries, are hot places for malware to be sitting on, and if you log in to a owned computer, you might just lose your passwords to a keylogger. So let's make sure you are not owned already and then set ourselves up to be safe in the future. How Can You Tell Remember the term indicators of compromise (IOC) from before?. There are a ton that can be used, some approaches more technical than others. Common non-techical indicators include constant pop ups, home page redirection, search engine redirection, the classic pile of toolbars, and the computer being slow and the fans working way too hard. Technical indicators include extra processes running, network requests, and things saved in places they shouldn't be. Looking for these technical indicators is called \"Threat Hunting\". It deserves its own section, but we will briefly go over a few ways you can identify the bad things on your computer. https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/05/how-to-tell-if-youre-infected-with-malware/ Visit the course page!

Basically, these companies execute the malware, break down the malware into tiny pieces and creates indicators for the different components and what the execution of them look like, so that they can identify them on your computer and completely delete them off. I recommend that you have Windows Defender running at all times for protection. There is no need to have any other anti-virus on your computer, more is not better.

Network Hunting Continuing along the idea of threat hunting, we can use network traffic to identify evil. If malware is on your network, it is going to try to talk out to its command and control server. There are plenty of ways to look at network traffic but I recommend the tool Glasswire and Wireshark for this purpose. Glasswire identifies processes making network connections and alerts on them. If the process doesn't make sense when it pops up, go to Wireshark and open up the stream to see if it makes sense. Tasks: Download Glasswire https://www.glasswire.com/ You already should have Wireshark downloaded. If not, download it. Look at the Glasswire alerts. Choose one of the alerts for something that isn't a webbrowser and identify the stream in Wireshark. Submit a screenshot of the data from Wireshark. Visit the course page!

Alright so your computer is clean, probably, after following the last steps, now if you get infected in the future the most likely scenario is that you ran someone else's code and gave them access to your computer. There's nothing to feel bad about, this could have happened in many ways, and it happens to the best of us. Common ways this could have occured are online installers, phishing, and downloaded tools getting a malicious update. We will go over each method, and how to avoid it in the future. Downloaded Something Nasty Downloading something nasty is the easiest way to do this, whether it is from an email, a big green download arrow on a website, or a program from a torrent site. Phishing is the most common, because it is the most targeted, which results in a higher install rate. One of the biggest things you can do to avoid getting phished is to learn what a phishing attempt looks like. Read this: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/06/somethings-phishy-how-to-detect-phishing-attempts/ Also, read this: https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-avoid-phishing-attacks Now what do you do if someone tries to phish you, or you are wondering if this is a phishing attempt? Read this: https://decentsecurity.com/malware-web-and-phishing-investigation/ If you get a phish, good chance other people are getting it as well. So you need to report it! Make sure you know how to report to your organization to protect everyone else! You could have also run some backdoored shit, whether from an online download, or packaged in with real software. A good move before downloading anything is run it through these sites listed in the anti-phishing tools. These sites are pretty awesome and use a lot of cool technology to make a determination if something is malicious. Attachment and file checkers use something called a \"sandbox\" to open the file/execute the program. The sandbox monitors the process created and looks for any malicious behavior, in addition to running anti-virus looking for a known bad. URL checkers use a browser to visit the URL and look for malicious behavior, like attempts at infection using an exploit. They also usually provide historical information about the website and if it has been used to host malware before. IP Checkers look at historical data for an IP address or block of IP addresses to see if they have been used for shady things in the past. Remember the difference between and IP and a URL? Tasks: Write a few sentences on why a URL could be clean historically but the IP address could be bad. This is going to require your understanding of hosting servers and domain names. Analyze a malicious attachment using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it. Analyze a malicious program using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it. Analyze a malicious URL using a few of the sites. Write about some of the data it provides and what you can do with it.

We are about to get philosophical. Remember how we were just talking about how there is straight up, NO possible way for us to know if your computer is owned? Well we are about to get into the exact same problem, but now for cleaning your computer. If you have evidence that a malicious program ran on your computer, you can never trust this computer ever again. That tiny PUP that kept changing your homepage to some Chinese marketplace could have been bundled with some nation state rootkit that overwrote your computer's foundational code down at the soul of the device and you aren't going to be able to remove that malware unless you return the silicon into sand. However, that is very, very, very unlikely. As we have said before, you are not going to be targeted by nation states, or really anyone at all. If you get hacked, almost certainly by an untargeted attack, the malware will drop itself off, establish persistence, and then do its thing. While there have been examples in the past of standard malware going for rootkit persistence, that is significantly more difficult on modern operating systems. 99% of the time, if antivirus identifies the malware and removes it, you are good and don't have to worry about any follow on problems. Sure, that does leave room for the next 1%, so my recommendation is remove the malware, let that computer chill for a day or two if you can afford to use another, and then run the malware scan again. If you keep finding malware you have a bigger problem, but the rest of the time, you can just go back to using the computer as normal. It is no life to buy a new computer every time you mess up, and it gets expensive fast. So with all that said, if you use your computer for nuclear launch codes, critical intellectual property, or managing the crypto wallets of your hoarded wealth in addition to casual internet surfing, don't destroy the pwned computer. Buy a new computer to do your serious business, and then clean up the old one as best you can and use the old computer to surf the web. Compartmentalization is key. So how do I get it clean again? Can't do better than this guide. https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/06/10-easy-steps-to-clean-your-infected-computer/ I might get some heat from some corners for recommending a specific malware remover, but hell, its Malwarebytes or Kaspersky and I'm not big on Russians. Also, go to a clean computer and change all of your passwords immediately. Allllll of them. What would happen if the malware doesn't all get deleted on the first run? If all the malware is still there, it means that the anti-virus you're using isn't very good, or that the malware is pretty good. Maybe both. Either way, you are not good enough to go and manually delete everything you need to delete the malware yourself, so best bet is don't use the computer for a few days, then try and delete it again using your tools after their signatures get updated. Think about it this way, if a piece of malware gets by your anti-virus' signatures, there is a good chance that it is somewhat new. If you got hacked by it in an untargeted attack, most likely many other people did as well. This will lead to the anti-virus company identifying the malware as persistent and then analyzing it to identify what it is missing in the first clean. Then they will update the signatures and have a more effective removal process the next time. If the malware's persistence mechanism is so good you, Windows, and Malwarebytes still can't beat it, your best move is to reinstall the operating system. This will work in most cases, though there is a small chance of a rootkit/bookit or worse, firmware malware persisting across OS installs. If this happens... get your computer to someone who can get it to the NSA because that's some high quality shit. They'll probably give you a sticker or something. Repeat Attack Vectors If you removed the malware, but you keep getting new malware a week or two later, and you are confident it isn't persistent, you need to figure out how you keep getting hit. Patching If you haven't patched, you are still vulnerable! You should have auto update on. Attachments If you, or someone else keeps getting hit with attachments/etc, they need some user training Pirated Software If you keep downloading pirated shit, you will keep getting popped. That is just how it goes. Porn Popups Same shit, stop going on sketchy porn sites and downloading things.

In fact, it is hard to imagine a more \"hostile\" network than a DoD network. But what does \"hostile\" mean? In this case, the general idea is that if computer A wishes to communicate with computer C, that means that they need to send all of their traffic through computer B. Gentleman's agreements not to look at that traffic might have worked on Arpanet, but not anymore. From Internet Service Providers (ISPs) working with governments to snoop on all your traffic, to deep sea submarine cable intercepts to sketchy free wifi hotspots, your internet browsing is recorded by a lot of people. And when I mean, a lot of people, I mean literally every single hop on your way across the internet (remember traceroute?) will have a complete log of your connections. They might not have the content if you have encrypted your traffic, but they will have records of the date/time the request was made, from who, and to where. This is accesssible to anyone with access to the logs, whether they own it, pwned it, or have a court order. Your IP address is likely shared, but if logs are kept all the way down, and they likely do exist, anything can be tracked down to you.

This can allow Computer B to impersonate both people to each other and have them each receive a totally incorrect message while never knowing that they are being listened in on.

OPSEC is king If someone has found you in real life, the game is over. There are all sorts of great technical approaches to protecting yourself we have gone over already, but technology only goes so far. There is always a log created digitally and if a motivated attacker wants you, they will get you technically. OPSEC is what keeps you off the radar, and if you are going to be on the radar, gives them a cold trail and a fake account to chase into the ground. If you follow these rules, you will do much better towards not getting arrested. What is OPSEC? Tasks: Submit what is the OPSEC Purple Dragon to laugh at some military heritage.

Compartmentalization is based around the idea that you have various public facing personas, and you are unable to keep all of them private. You will never manage to completely erase your public, legal name persona from public record, and while you can attempt to keep it off the internet, it's a losing battle. Taken to an extreme, if you have separate personas for every website you use, with the appropriate technical protections we already went over, you could have a distributed profile that means that the discovery or unmasking of any specific account having no effect on the others. Like everything we are talking about in this course, it's all about risk mitigation, at the cost of convenience. Keep working on the mentality of this, understanding risks, their mitigations, and how it fits into individual and group risk tolerances. Tasks: Listen to the 10 Crack Commandments (mostly because it is a great song): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYb_8MM1tGQ Read this: https://medium.com/@thegrugq/operational-security-and-the-real-world-3c07e7eeb2e8 Think about the reasoning behind compartmentalization. You've already determined your risk model, so compartmentalization only matters as much as your risk model requires. Which of your accounts require compartmentalization? If you followed the directions earlier in the course, if you have a reset available for your password manager it is controlled by a gmail account that you don't use on any other sites. Read Grugq's Commandments: https://grugq.tumblr.com/post/60463307186/rules-of-clandestine-operation If you are taking this course, you likely do not require any advanced tradecraft knowledge, but it's still useful to wrap your head around the concepts. They are generally applicable to a lot of common scenarios, and knowing them can only help. Listen to the 10 Hack Commandments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr8ILq1a_yw It's by a guy called Dual Core, makes some pretty dope stuff . His number one song is 'Drink All the Booze, Hack All the Things'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y Let's put it this way, hackers don't take themselves all that seriously. If you listen to the lyrics to 'Hack All the Things' you will probably understand about one third of the references, at best. If you don't like it or are too cool for nerdcore rap, that's fine. If you stick around eventually you'll understand most of it and you'll go nuts when someone throws it on during a late night hack sesh after you've been passing around a bottle of whiskey.

Physical attacks A physical attack on your computer, called an \"Evil Maid\", is a classic attack and near impossible to defeat. If someone has hands on keyboard after stealing your device, they own that computer unless you have protected it properly. If you have protected it properly and someone modifies the hardware, then you use it, then you are still screwed. If someone has you and the computer, you are screwed. Long story short, it is better for them to not know you are worth attacking, thus, OPSEC. However, sometimes you can't do that. Maybe you are a high profile individual who is in a hotel, maybe you live in a government dorm, maybe you are traveling and get border searched. This is the guide for those times. Tasks: Read this: http://images.secure.f-secure.com/Web/FSecure/%7B319382b2-a040-4c88-bd94-20eed01bf22f%7D_F-Secure-Evil-Maid-Guide.pdf Where does an evil maid attack fall into your personal threat model? You can also mount an encrypted partition in your OS, and use that to hold a virtual machine to do your important work on. That gives you a ton of deniability, especially with the ability to make multiple partitions that unlock to different passwords. Remember though, if you get hacked on the outside, you get hacked in the VM as well. Either way, you need FDE and secure boot if you want to beat an evil maid. Alright, now that you know that you need FDE and Secure Boot, lets go into various physical attacks on a computer and defenses against them. Tackling you off of the computer while logged in * You can try a quick shutdown Read about Cold Boot attacks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack While this sounds hard, I've done one before in a controlled environment. Actually pretty easy. Breaking in to your hotel room and installing a keylogger, then breaking back in later and stealing your laptop now that they have the password. Or just arresting you. * Classic Boot attack Installing keylogger Malicious hardware to a turned on computer USB Malware * BAdusb * Rubberducky * BashBunny FIREWIRE Turn off your computer when you leave User Introduced Attacks Hardware intercepts* Some chips will get intercepted en route, replaced/modified, and sent to their final destination Backdoored chips Some chips will come off the assembly line with backdoors in them already Malicious hardware to turned off compter * Throw a new chip on your computer Keylogger in keyboard NSA Playset: http://www.nsaplayset.org/chuckwagon Electronic Emissions * Read this: Taking you and your computer and forcing you to give up password \"Rubber hose cryptography\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis https://xkcd.com/538/ Some encryption tools allow the possibility of multiple partitions, so that multiple passwords can be used. Only one password unlocks what you are actually trying to hide, others open different partitions, and there is no way of proving that there are multiple partition/password pairs... this doesn't work very well legally, but might work. A little bit. Legal issues surrounding forced password disclosure* There is more constitutional law in this field than you ever expected. Further on courses will discuss how all this plays together but: Basically, US you are good, plead the 5th, self-incrimination. You'll still probably go down, but not for what is on the hard drive. Europe, you are going to jail Most other countries, jail \"Not chill\" countries, beaten until you give it up, then jail Biometrics If your device unlocks with anything on your body, they can just take you and open your stuff. Fingerprint/retina/voice/face unlocks are not protected by Constitution, they can just make you unlock these things if they have you. Lockpicking Lockpicking and other security bypass techniques are very popular in the community, for obvious reasons. Many conferences have lockpick competitions and plenty of people carry picks around, because there is nothing worse than getting locked out of things you are allowed access to, but don't have a key. Read this: https://www.art-of-lockpicking.com/how-to-pick-a-lock-guide/. At some point we will figure out getting lockpicks to participants so that they can practice. Visit the course page!
